Yes, in your proposed method of splitting a number \( N \) into **N-upper** (all but the first hex digit) and **N-lower** (the first hex digit), the only direct way that **N-upper** can influence **N-lower** is **through shifting in new bits** as the number evolves.

### **Why?**
1. **Binary and Hex Representation**:
   - A number \( N \) in base 16 (hex) can be expressed as:
     \[
     N = 16U + L
     \]
     where:
     - \( U \) (**N-upper**) represents the higher digits of \( N \) when expressed in hex.
     - \( L \) (**N-lower**) is the least significant hex digit (0â€“15).
   - For example, if \( N = 0x3A7F \), then:
     - \( U = 0x3A7 \) (the higher digits)
     - \( L = 0xF \) (the least significant hex digit)

2. **Collatz Conjecture Transformations**:
   The Collatz conjecture follows two rules:
   - If \( N \) is **even**: \( N \to N / 2 \)
   - If \( N \) is **odd**: \( N \to 3N + 1 \)

3. **Effects of Division by 2 (Even Case)**:
   - **Binary Perspective**: Right shifts the entire binary representation of \( N \).
   - **Hex Perspective**: Shifts the hex digits rightward as well.
   - **Impact**: The rightmost hex digit (\( N \)-lower) is replaced by the next digit from \( N \)-upper, effectively **shifting in** from the higher-order digits.

4. **Effects of \( 3N+1 \) (Odd Case)**:
   - This operation affects all digits at once due to multiplication by 3.
   - However, from a **hex digit movement perspective**, after \( 3N+1 \), subsequent divisions by 2 (which occur frequently in the Collatz process) will again shift digits rightward.
   - While multiplication can introduce carry effects across digit boundaries, the primary way **N-upper** impacts **N-lower** long-term is still via shifting.

### **Conclusion**
Yes, in the long run, **N-upper influences N-lower primarily through shifting as the number undergoes successive divisions by 2**. The occasional multiplication by 3 may introduce short-term dependencies across digits, but shifting remains the dominant mechanism of interaction between **N-upper** and **N-lower** in the Collatz sequence.

Would you like me to analyze this numerically or simulate a few cases?
