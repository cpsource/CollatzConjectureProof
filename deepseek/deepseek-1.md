The sequence you're referring to is known as the **Collatz Conjecture**, one of the most famous unsolved problems in mathematics. The conjecture states that for any positive integer \( n \), if you repeatedly apply the following rules:

1. If \( n \) is even, divide it by 2 (\( n / 2 \)).
2. If \( n \) is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1 (\( 3n + 1 \)).

The sequence will always eventually reach the number **1**, regardless of the starting number.

### Why Does It Converge to 1?
Despite its simple formulation, the Collatz Conjecture remains unproven. However, here are some observations and insights that help explain why it *appears* to always converge to 1:

1. **Reduction for Even Numbers**:
   - When \( n \) is even, dividing it by 2 reduces the number significantly. This ensures that even numbers shrink rapidly.

2. **Behavior for Odd Numbers**:
   - When \( n \) is odd, \( 3n + 1 \) makes the number larger, but the subsequent steps (dividing by 2) tend to bring it back down. For example:
     - Start with \( n = 5 \):
       - \( 5 \) is odd → \( 3 \times 5 + 1 = 16 \).
       - \( 16 \) is even → \( 16 / 2 = 8 \).
       - \( 8 \) is even → \( 8 / 2 = 4 \).
       - \( 4 \) is even → \( 4 / 2 = 2 \).
       - \( 2 \) is even → \( 2 / 2 = 1 \).

3. **Empirical Evidence**:
   - The conjecture has been tested extensively for numbers up to very large values (e.g., \( 2^{60} \)), and in every case, the sequence eventually reaches 1.

4. **Probabilistic Argument**:
   - On average, the sequence tends to decrease over time. When \( n \) is odd, \( 3n + 1 \) increases the number, but the subsequent divisions by 2 (which happen more frequently) bring it down. Over time, the sequence is more likely to decrease than increase.

5. **Looping Behavior**:
   - Once the sequence reaches 1, it enters a loop: \( 1 \rightarrow 4 \rightarrow 2 \rightarrow 1 \). This is the only known loop in the sequence.

### Why Is It Still a Conjecture?
Despite its simplicity, the Collatz Conjecture remains unproven because:
1. **Lack of a General Proof**:
   - While the sequence converges to 1 for all tested numbers, no one has been able to prove that it holds for *every* positive integer.

2. **Complex Behavior**:
   - The sequence can behave unpredictably for certain numbers, rising and falling in ways that are difficult to analyze mathematically.

3. **Deep Mathematical Connections**:
   - The problem is connected to deep areas of mathematics, such as number theory, dynamical systems, and computability theory, making it resistant to simple solutions.

### Example Sequences
Here are a few examples of sequences converging to 1:

1. **Starting with \( n = 6 \)**:
   - \( 6 \rightarrow 3 \rightarrow 10 \rightarrow 5 \rightarrow 16 \rightarrow 8 \rightarrow 4 \rightarrow 2 \rightarrow 1 \).

2. **Starting with \( n = 7 \)**:
   - \( 7 \rightarrow 22 \rightarrow 11 \rightarrow 34 \rightarrow 17 \rightarrow 52 \rightarrow 26 \rightarrow 13 \rightarrow 40 \rightarrow 20 \rightarrow 10 \rightarrow 5 \rightarrow 16 \rightarrow 8 \rightarrow 4 \rightarrow 2 \rightarrow 1 \).

3. **Starting with \( n = 1 \)**:
   - \( 1 \rightarrow 4 \rightarrow 2 \rightarrow 1 \) (enters the loop).

### Conclusion
The Collatz Conjecture is a fascinating example of how a simple rule can lead to complex and unpredictable behavior. While it remains unproven, the overwhelming empirical evidence suggests that the sequence always converges to 1. Mathematicians continue to study the problem, and solving it could lead to new insights into the nature of numbers and computation.
