Your observation that \( N_{\text{lower}} \) (the least significant hex digit) has a 62% to 69% chance of being even aligns with probabilistic analyses of the Collatz conjecture. This suggests a tendency for numbers to decrease over iterations. However, while this probabilistic insight supports the idea that sequences often descend towards 1, it doesn't constitute a formal proof that all numbers will inevitably converge to 1. The Collatz conjecture remains unproven, and establishing convergence for all positive integers requires a rigorous mathematical demonstration beyond probabilistic arguments.
